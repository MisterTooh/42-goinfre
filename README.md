# 42-goinfre

üö© Any passwords saved locally will be deleted each time you run this script. Any passwords saved in a cloud or via Browser applications will remain intact.

This script will fix the recurring issue with 42 lab iMac memory, every time I go to a 42 lab to work I get an error message like this:

```
You don't have space
```

## Ok, What does this script do?

This script will Create a link to all files in ~/goinfre for:

- Downloads folder.
- Caches folder.

It will also download Chrome and VScode and also add them to ~/goinfre and create a shortcut to them on your Desktop

Now only 40% of the memory from the available 5gb of space is used, so I think this script is good to use.

## How to use this script?

Simple! Clone this repository and run the script!

You will need to set permissions for the script by running the below command.

```
chmod +x be_free.sh
```

This command will give Executable permission to the script file.

To run the script, simply run the below:

```
$ ./be_free.sh
```

Or

```
$ bash be_free.sh
```

Now just take a deep breath üòÅ everything is done.
