# 42-goinfre  

üö©any password or extension for vscode and chrome will be remove if you run this first time.


this script to fix issue with 42 lab imac space , every time i go to 42 lab to work I get error message like this:

```
You don't have space 
```
## Ok , What script do you think ?

actually , Create link to file in ~/goinfre for:
- Downloads folder.
- Caches folder.

and download chrome and vscode and also add to ~/goinfre and create shortcut to desktop for chrome and vscode 

Now I use only 40% from 5 gb of space , so I think this script is good to use.

## How use this script ?
 
clone this repository and run this script

```
chmod +x be_free.sh
```

```
$ ./be_free.sh
```
and just breath üòÅ every thing done.
